                    Unlike normal contoured fonts, pixel fonts require special treatment to get them to display
                    correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normal fonts can be displayed at any size, but pixel fonts must be rendered at
                    a <span class="gold">multiple of size 16</span> to look correct:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="./README_files/sizing.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also have to make sure <span class="gold">antialiasing</span> is disabled, or the font
                    will look blurry like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="./README_files/antialiasing.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    To fix this, search for an <em>antialiasing</em>, <em>AA</em>, or <em>hinting</em> setting in
                    your software. For example, when using the text tool in Photoshop, you can disable it here:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="./README_files/photoshop.png">
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-bar"></div>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="header">Letter Kerning</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-bar"></div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Every font has a list of <em>kerning pairs</em>, which are numbers associated
                    with certain pairs of characters. These tables are built into the provided TTF
                    files, and if you are using the other assets, they are provided in the fonts'
                    associated data files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This kerning number represents how much to x-offset the right character when
                    it is positioned immediately after the left. When using custom renderers, it
                    is recommended (when using a non-monospace font) to offset your cursor by these
                    values to make words fit together more tightly, improving readability.

                    Because of the large character set and kerning tables, there are bound be small
                    errors, letters and punctuation that don't look quite right, and so on. In the
